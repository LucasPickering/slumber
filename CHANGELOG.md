### Changed

- [BREAKING] Key profiles/chains/requests by ID in collection file
- [BREAKING] Merge request history into a single DB file
  - Request history (and UI state) will be lost
- [BREAKING] `show` subcommand now takes a `target` argument
  - Right now the only option is `slumber show dir`, which has the same behavior as the old `slumber show` (except now it prints the bare directory)

- Filter request history by profile ([#74](https://github.com/LucasPickering/slumber/issues/74))
- Hide sensitive chain values in preview
- Change fullscreen keybinding from F11 to F
  - F11 in some cases is eaten by the IDE or OS, which is annoying

### Added

- Add `slumber show` subcommand

### Changed

- Remove keybinding to reload collection
  - Not useful now that the TUI has automatic reloading
- Move to stable Rust channel and add MSRV of 1.74

### Fixed

- Don't panic if the collection file is invalid on first startup [#34](https://github.com/LucasPickering/slumber/issues/34)
  - The TUI will now show an empty screen, and watch the collection file for changes
- Fix long status code reasons getting cut off in response header [#40](https://github.com/LucasPickering/slumber/issues/40)
- Trim leading/trailing newlines from header values to prevent validation error

## [0.7.0] - 2023-11-16

### Added

- Added recursive templates for profile values, using the `!template` tag before a value

### Changed

- Parse templates up front instead of during render
- Switch to nom for template parsing
  - Parse errors should be better now

## [0.6.0] - 2023-11-11

### Added

- Add ability to preview template values. This will show the rendered value under current settings [#29](https://github.com/LucasPickering/slumber/issues/29)

- Add `command` source type for chained values, which uses stdout from an executed subprocess command [#31](https://github.com/LucasPickering/slumber/issues/31)

### Changed

- HTTP method is now a plain string, not a template string. This simplifies some internal logic, and I don't think there was a compelling reason to make a template in the first place.
