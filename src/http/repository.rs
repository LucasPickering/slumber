/// all operations are internally fallible. Generally speaking, any error that
/// occurs *after* opening the DB connection should be an internal bug, but
/// should be shown to the user whenever possible. All operations are also
/// async because of the database and the locking nature of the interior cache.
/// They generally will be fast though, so it's safe to block on them in the
/// main loop. Do not call this from the draw phase though; instead, cache the
/// results in UI state for as long as they're needed.
///
/// Only requests that received a valid HTTP response should be stored.
/// In-flight requests, invalid requests, and requests that failed to complete
/// (e.g. because of a network error) should not (and cannot) be stored.

/// Note: Despite all the operations being async, the actual database isn't
/// async. Each operation will asynchronously wait for the connection mutex,
/// then block while performing the operation. This is just a shortcut, if it
/// becomes a bottleneck we can change that.
