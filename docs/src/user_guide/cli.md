# Command Line Interface

While Slumber is primary intended as a TUI, it also provides a Command Line Interface (CLI). The CLI can be used to send requests, just like the TUI. It also provides some utility commands for functionality not available in the TUI. For a full list of available commands see the side bar or run:

```sh
slumber help
```

Some common CLI use cases:

- [Send requests](../cli/request.md)
- [Import from an external format](../cli/import.md)
- [Generate request in an external format (e.g. curl)](../cli/generate.md)
- [View Slumber configuration/metadata](../cli/show.md)
